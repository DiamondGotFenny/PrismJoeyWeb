# Zustand Phase 2 - Hotfix & Bug Resolution Summary 🔧

## ✅ RESOLVED: "Maximum update depth exceeded" in PracticePage.tsx

**Status: FIXED** ✅

The infinite loop issue has been successfully resolved through the following changes:

### 🛠️ Final Solution Applied:

1. **Fixed Zustand Selector Object References:**

   - **Root Cause:** All exported selectors (`usePracticeSession`, `usePracticeQuestion`, etc.) were returning new objects on every render, causing React to detect changes even when the underlying data hadn't changed.
   - **Fix:** Refactored all selectors to use individual field subscriptions combined with `useMemo` to create stable object references:

   ```ts
   // Before (caused infinite re-renders):
   export const usePracticeSession = () =>
     usePracticeStore((state) => ({
       sessionId: state.sessionId,
       session: state.session,
       isSessionOver: state.isSessionOver,
     }));

   // After (stable references):
   export const usePracticeSession = () => {
     const sessionId = usePracticeStore((state) => state.sessionId);
     const session = usePracticeStore((state) => state.session);
     const isSessionOver = usePracticeStore((state) => state.isSessionOver);
     return useMemo(
       () => ({ sessionId, session, isSessionOver }),
       [sessionId, session, isSessionOver]
     );
   };
   ```

2. **Enhanced `startSession` State Management:**

   - Added synchronous state clearing at the beginning of `startSession` to ensure clean state:

   ```ts
   set((state) => {
     state.isLoading = true;
     state.error = null;
     // Ensure previous session data is cleared before starting a new one
     state.sessionId = null;
     state.session = null;
     state.currentQuestion = null;
     state.questionNumber = 0;
     state.totalQuestions = 0;
   });
   ```

3. **Removed `useEffect` Cleanup Issues:**
   - The cleanup function in `PracticePage.tsx`'s main `useEffect` that was calling `resetSession()` was removed to break the infinite loop cycle.

### 🧪 **Test Results:**

- ✅ Practice page loads successfully
- ✅ Questions load without infinite re-renders
- ✅ No more "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- ✅ No more "getSnapshot should be cached" warnings

## 🆕 NEW BUG: Answer Input Not Working

**Status: INVESTIGATING** 🔍

**Issue Description:**
After resolving the infinite loop issue, a new problem has emerged where users cannot fill answers into the input slots using the numeric keypad.

**Symptoms:**

- Practice page loads correctly and displays questions
- Numeric keypad renders properly
- Clicking keypad numbers does not populate the answer field
- Both regular and columnar question types may be affected

**Initial Investigation Needed:**

1. Check if keypad click handlers are properly connected
2. Verify `setCurrentAnswer` action is working
3. Ensure answer state updates are propagating to UI
4. Check for any event handler binding issues

**Files to Investigate:**

- `PracticePage.tsx` - keypad event handlers
- `NumericKeypad.tsx` - button click events
- `usePracticeStore.ts` - answer state management actions

## 🚦 Current Status & Next Steps

**Completed:**

- ✅ Fixed infinite re-render loop
- ✅ Stable practice page loading
- ✅ Question loading works

**In Progress:**

- 🔍 Investigating answer input functionality
- 🔍 Testing keypad event propagation

**Next Actions:**

1. Debug keypad click event handling
2. Verify answer state management flow
3. Test both regular and columnar question answer input
4. Ensure UI updates reflect state changes properly
