## Resolved Bugs

### 1. ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Backend Server Hangs on Help Request Timeout

**Status:** Fixed  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Description:** When user clicks "Â∏ÆÊàë‰∏Ä‰∏ã" (Help) button and the LLM request times out or doesn't respond, the FastAPI backend server becomes unresponsive. Even Ctrl+C cannot terminate the server - only force-closing the terminal works.  
**Solution:** Implemented async timeout handling using `asyncio.wait_for` with 40-second timeout and `run_in_executor` to prevent blocking the FastAPI event loop. LLM calls now run in background threads with automatic fallback to mock help content on timeout or failure. Server remains responsive and gracefully handles LLM service issues.

### 2. ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Critical Error on Exercise Session Page Load

**Status:** Fixed  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** Loading math exercise page showed error: "ExerciseSessionPage.tsx:543 [ExerciseSessionPage] Critical error: No current question loaded despite passing guards"  
**Solution:** Fixed race condition by adding proper loading state handling for component initialization

### 3. ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Test Mode Code in Production Component

**Status:** Fixed  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** ExerciseSessionPage contains 'test mode' code that should not be in production. Testing should use proper mocks instead of embedded test logic.  
**Solution:** Completely removed all test-related code from ExerciseSessionPage. Implemented proper localStorage mocking strategy in test helpers using `gotoPracticeSession()` function. Fixed localStorage key mismatch and added missing data-testid attribute for test element targeting. Tests now use non-invasive mocking without any test code in production components.

### 4. ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Columnar Calculation Answer Not Displayed

**Status:** Fixed  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** In columnar calculation exercises, when user submits answer and presses confirm, the correct answer is not displayed to the user.  
**Solution:** Enhanced ColumnarCalculation component to properly display correct answers when showCorrectAnswer=true. Added logic to calculate and display the complete correct solution, highlighting previously blank (user-filled) cells in green.

### 6. ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Keyboard Input Not Working in Columnar Calculation

**Status:** Fixed  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** Users cannot input numbers using keyboard in columnar calculation mode.  
**Solution:** Added comprehensive keyboard input support for columnar calculations including numeric keys (0-9), Backspace/Delete for clearing, Enter for submission, and arrow keys for navigation. Implemented custom event system to bridge keyboard input with existing keypad logic.

### 7. ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Input Border Disappears After Number Entry

**Status:** Fixed  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** In columnar calculation, after user fills a number into a blank field, the border of that input field disappears.  
**Solution:** Added CSS styling for filled cells with green borders and light green backgrounds. Implemented visual distinction between empty, filled, and correct answer states. Filled cells now maintain visible borders and proper hover effects.

### 5. ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Voice Help Issues in Columnar Calculation

**Status:** Fixed  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** Voice help for columnar calculations had multiple issues:

- Single digits were described as double digits due to leading zero padding
- Missing parts were described as underscores ("‰∏ãÊ®™Á∫ø") instead of blanks
- No timeout protection for TTS service causing potential server hangs
  **Solution:** Fixed digit representation in TTS service by replacing underscores with question marks and stripping leading zeros. Added comprehensive timeout guards (45 seconds) to all three voice help endpoints using asyncio.wait_for and run_in_executor to prevent server blocking. Enhanced LLM prompts with clearer instructions about referring to "Á©∫Ê†º" instead of "ÈóÆÂè∑" and limiting response length.

### 8. ‚úÖ **FIXED** - ColumnarCalculation Undefined Digit Crash

**Status:** Fixed  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** During columnar-calculation practice, submitting an answer sometimes triggered `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')` originating from `ColumnarCalculation.renderDigit`. This broke the UI and halted automated E2E runs.  
**Solution:** Added defensive check to treat `undefined` digits the same as `null/''` before calling `toString()`. Implemented in `ColumnarCalculation.tsx` (see commit on 2025-06-12).  
**Fixed Date:** 2025-06-12

### 9. ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Columnar Calculation Shows Only RHS Number

**Status:** Fixed  
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** For columnar calculation questions, the result page and in-practice feedback displayed only the right-hand side number (e.g., "91") instead of the full completed equation. Students therefore could not see which digits should fill the '?' placeholders (e.g., "82 + 09 = 91"). Normal arithmetic questions were unaffected.  
**Solution:**

1. **Frontend** ‚Äì Enhanced `usePracticeStore.submitCurrentAnswer` to build a zero-padded full-expression string (operand1 op operand2 = result) and pass it to `showFeedback`. `ExerciseResultPage` logic updated earlier to render this expression for columnar questions.
2. **Tests** ‚Äì E2E spec asserts that `.correct-answer-reveal` contains "=" confirming full expression is rendered.
