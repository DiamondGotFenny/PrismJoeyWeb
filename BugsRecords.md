### 3. ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Test Mode Code in Production Component

**Status:** Fixed  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** ExerciseSessionPage contains 'test mode' code that should not be in production. Testing should use proper mocks instead of embedded test logic.  
**Solution:** Completely removed all test-related code from ExerciseSessionPage. Implemented proper localStorage mocking strategy in test helpers using `gotoPracticeSession()` function. Fixed localStorage key mismatch and added missing data-testid attribute for test element targeting. Tests now use non-invasive mocking without any test code in production components.
